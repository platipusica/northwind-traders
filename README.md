Northwind Traders MS Access Template v1 semi-automatically migrated to the Web with the help of Jam.py.

Semi-automated means any Access database can be migrated to a modern SQLite3, and the Front End can be built automatically with the default look.
All by no-code. 
The Front End can be modified additionally with no-code as well, or with a minimum code for Buttons, etc.
